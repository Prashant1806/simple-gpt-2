# simple-gpt-2
Python code example for building a generative transformer chatbot with a GUI using the Tkinter library.








The Hugging Face Transformers library and Tkinter are among the libraries that we first load into this code. Finally, we use the pipeline function to import the pre-trained GPT-2 model.

To continue producing chatbot responses, we specify a function named generate_response.

To handle user input, we create a function called send_message. The function obtains user input from an entry widget, creates a chatbot answer with the help of the generate_response function, and then uses the insert method to add both the user input and the chatbot response to a chatbox widget.

The Tk class from Tkinter was then used to configure the GUI. We also include a chatbox widget to show the discussion, an entry widget for the user to type messages, and a send button to send messages.


Finally, we launch the GUI main loop by calling the root window's mainloop function. When the application is operating, the user can use the entry widget to send messages and the chatbox widget to receive chatbot responses.
